This puts the picture where we need it to be. 
Few nice ideas to note:
1. height has been set to auto, which auto resizes the pic to fit to our fixed width which is hard coded.
Without auto, there is a possibility that the image we tried to display, became oddly disoriented beacuse of the arbitray fix in width

2. Very cleverly, the box prop which merely specifies coordinated of the box, we ought to draw, is used by CSS, to draw the box. 
This css was taken from somewhere on the net, dont remember where?
