This component is the navigation bar right at the top. As of now, it is a very simply, right justified underlined, clickable text that canegd based on some if conditions realted to one if its props "isSignedIn". However there is a lot of scope to imporve this using material UI.

OnRouteChnage is a function that is passed down as props from app.js, it is triggered whenever onClick event is triggerd.
Note the peculiar arrow notation used here. This is inmportant, otherwise this function will be called simply on rednering this component, which no one wants.
