to start up:
1. create-react-app name_of_your_app
//lets assume its called test
this will set up test, and create a folder called test after isntalling all the files and required dependencies

2. cd test
3. npm start
this will auto create a dev environment, aka a local host:3000 (by default) webpage, which will lilsten to changes you save in your code files, and appropriately update the page

note:
1. basic idea behind state transitions:
Whenever an action happens in a component, that triggers a state change, it calls a function taht is passed down as props to
it from the app.js file. This function handles the statetransitons.

2. for debugging, remember you can use, logger and some nodethunk or something. just refer google for this.
Havent used it here.

3. if you want any style to be globally enforcing, change index.css file
